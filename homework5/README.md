# Homework \#5
*python data types, conda environments, control flow*  


## Problem 0
Create your personal branch in this repo via github (i.e. you don't need the command line
tools to do this). Give it whatever name you like. **Now, Fork this repo!!**. `git clone`
your fork to your local machine. Complete the rest of these exercises on your machine.

## Problem 1 - `conda env`ironment
- Create a new conda environment named `hmw5` and use python 3.5 (I know 3.7 is latest).
- Install `jupyter` in this environment.


## Problem 2 - `Closed Laptop`
In other words, try to do these without the aid of your broswer or `docstrings`.
1. Provide the expected output, if error, put "error".  
    a. len({1, 1, 1.0, 1j, 'hello'})  
    b. len((1, 1, 1.0, 1j, 'hello'))  
    c. len([1, 1, 1.0, 1j, 'hello'])  
    d. z = {1, 4.0, 'no'}; z[0]  
    e. z = (1, 4.0, 'no'); z[0] = 9  
    f. z = [1, 4.0, 'no']; z[0] = 9  
    g. (e) demonstrates what property of tuples?  
    h. (f) demonstrates what property of lists?  
    
## Problem 3
Using the conda environment from `Problem 1`, start a jupyter client-server application. Use
this application to create a notebook named `homework5`. Within this notebook:
1. Print all available magics available.  
2. Demonstrate understanding of **`line magics`** by using one to print the current working directory.  
3. Demonstrate understanding of **`cell magics`** by using one to print the current working directory.  
4. Create a list with the elements 'whiskey', 'tango', 'foxtrot' and call it names.  
5. Create a tuple with the elements 'happy', 'eager', 'sad' and call it adjectives.  
6. Use a `for` loop (or multiple for loops) to create all possible adjective-noun combinations (e.g. 'sad-tango').  
7. Using a new cell, copy code from 6. Modify the copy of the loop so that `sad-tango` is never printed.  
8. Using a new cell, copy code from 6. Modify the copy of the loop so that `happy-foxtrot` triggers the looping to stop.  

## Problem 4
1. Export your environment to a .yml file.

## Problem 5
1. Make sure all materials (i.e. updates to this README, juypter notebook, .yml file) are all
within the `home_work` repo in the homework 5 folder.
2. Complete the local git workflow to get the your answers in a commit.
3. git push these changes to **your fork**, you can choose the branch.
4. From your fork, submit a pull request that **puts these changes in your branch** in the bios821-2018 organization.
